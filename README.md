## Purpose

The purpose of this project is the justify more vision care supplies for Houston's underserved community. This includes reading glasses, sunglasses, and protective cases. We were awarded the 2024 Baylor College of Medicine Gold Humanism Service Project Grant to support this initiative. We are currently applying for the Gold Summer Student Fellowship to further provide funds for ophthalmology screening equipment.
